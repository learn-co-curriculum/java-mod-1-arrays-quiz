# Multiple Choice Question

What is wrong with the following line of code:

```java
int [] numbers = new int[10];

// Problem line
numbers[numbers.length] = 9;
```

## Incorrect

The array cannot have a mixture of data types.

> Note quite. While it is true that an array cannot have a mixture of data
> types. The value that is being assigned to the array element is the same
> data type as the array definition.
>
> Look closer at the index.

## Incorrect

It should be `numbers.length()` inside the square brackets.

> Note quite. `length` is a property of an array, not a method. So we don't need
> the `()` after `length`.
> 
> Look closer at the index.

## Correct

The array index is out of bounds.

> Correct! Our indexes start at 0 in Java; therefore, the last index will be
> `numbers[numbers.length - 1]`.

## Incorrect

There is nothing wrong with that line of code.

> Note quite. This line will actually throw an error if we try to run it in a
> program.
> 
> Look closer at the index that is being referenced.
